The package `DocExtensions` provides small but well-directed extensions to documentation tools as [Documenter.jl] and [Literate.jl], as well as some generic extensions to Markdown. In addition, it includes a simple but generic file processor for pre- or post-processing of any kind of text files.

## Dependencies
`DocExtensions` only relies on Julia standard packages.
